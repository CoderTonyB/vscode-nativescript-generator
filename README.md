# vscode-nativescript-generator

This extension allows you to easily add boilerplate Nativescript/Angular files to your Visual Studio Code project

> Based on code from from [Sebastian Baar](https://github.com/sebastianbaar/vscode-add-angular2-files) VS Code Add Angular2 Files 
> and [Josh Sommer](https://github.com/TheOriginalJosh/vscode-add-angular-native-files) vscode-add-angular-native-files

## Feature Request?

Open an issue at https://github.com/CoderTonyB/vscode-nativescript-generator/issues and I'll see what I can do about adding it.  Feel free to contribute to the project there as well!

## Changelog

## 0.0.1 Initial Release
## 0.0.6 changed .ts file paths so they default to ./pages/pagename/pagename.component.ts


## Features

Right click on a file or a folder in your current project. In the context menu is the option to add a native script page

### Add Nativescript Page

This command adds the following files to your new folder (let's assume you typed in `home`):
```
home/home.component.ts
home/home.component.html
home/home.component.css
```
